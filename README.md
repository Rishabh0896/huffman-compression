# Huffman Coding Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation of Huffman coding, a popular data compression algorithm. Huffman coding is used to compress and decompress data efficiently, making it a useful tool for various applications.

## Features

- Huffman coding algorithm implementation.
- Compression of text data using Huffman codes.
- Decompression of Huffman-encoded data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Open the project in your Java development environment (e.g. IntelliJ).

3. Build and run the project to access the Huffman coding functionality.

```gradle
gradle build
```
4. The runnable jar can be found in build/libs
  
5. Place the jar in the folder where you need to compress the text file and run the following command to compress and decompress
```shell
java -jar huffman-compression.jar <YOUR_TEXT_FILE> compress # Compress
java -jar huffman-compression.jar <YOUR_TEXT_FILE> decompress # Decompress
```
